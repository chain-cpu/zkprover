# zkEVM Prover

zkEVM proof generator

## General info

The zkEVM Prover process can provide up to 3 RPC services:

### Prover service

- It calls the Prover component that executes the input data (a batch of EVM transactions), calculates the resulting state, and generates the proof of the calculation based on the PIL polynomials definition and their constrains.
- When called by the Prover service, the Executor component combines 14 state machines that process the input data to generate the evaluations of the committed polynomials, required to generate the proof. Every state machine generates their computation evidence data, and the more complex calculus demonstrations are delegated to the next state machine.
- The Prover component calls the Stark component to generate a proof of the Executor state machines committed polynomials.
- The interface of this service is defined by the file zk-prover.proto.

### Executor service

- It calls the Executor component that executes the input data (a batch of EVM transactions) and calculates the resulting state. The proof is not generated.
- It provides a fast way to check if the proposed batch of transactions is properly built and it fits the amount of work that can be proven in one single batch.
- When called by the Executor service, the Executor component only uses the Main state machine, since the committed polynomials are not required as the proof will not be generated.
- The interface of this service is defined by the file executor.proto.

### StateDB service

- It provides an interface to access the state of the system (a Merkle tree) and the database where the state is stored.
- It is used by the executor and the prover, as the single source of state. It can be used to get state details, e.g. account balances.
- The interface of this service is defined by the file statedb.proto.

## Setup

### Compile

The following packages must be installed.

```sh
$ sudo apt install build-essential libbenchmark-dev libomp-dev libgmp-dev nlohmann-json3-dev postgresql libpqxx-dev libpqxx-doc nasm libsecp256k1-dev grpc-proto libsodium-dev libprotobuf-dev libssl-dev cmake libgrpc++-dev protobuf-compiler protobuf-compiler-grpc uuid-dev
```

To download the files needed to run the prover, you have to execute the following command, which will be downloaded in the `testvector` folder

```
$ make download_dependencies
```

Run `make` to compile the project (this process can take up to ~3 hours)

```sh
$ make clean
$ make -j
```

To run the testvector:

```
$ cd testvectors
$ ../build/zkProver -c config_runFile.json
```

### StateDB service database

To use persistence in the StateDB (Merkle-tree) service you must create the database objects needed by the service. To do this run the shell script:

```sh
$ ./tools/statedb/create_db.sh <database> <user> <password>
```

For example:

```sh
$ ./tools/statedb/create_db.sh testdb statedb statedb
```

### Build & run docker

```sh
$ sudo docker build -t zkprover .
$ sudo docker run --rm --network host -ti -p 50051:50051 -p 50061:50061 -p 50071:50071 -v $PWD/testvectors:/usr/src/app zkprover input_executor.json
```

## Usage

To execute the Prover you need to provide a `config.json` file that contains the parameters that allow us to configure the different Prover options. By default, the Prover loads the `config.json`file located in the `testvectors`folder. The most relevant parameters are commented below with the default value for the provided `config.json` file:

| Parameter         | Default                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The PostgreSQL database connection string has the following format: `"postgresql://<user>:<password>@<ip>:<port>/<database>"`. For example: `"postgresql://statedb:statedb@127.0.0.1:5432/testdb"` |

For example: `"127.0.0.1:50061"`                                                                                                                          |

To run a proof test you must perform the following steps:

- Edit the `config.json` file and set the parameter `"runFile"` to `"true"`. The rest of the parameters must be set to `"false"`. Also set the parameter `"databaseURL` to `"local"` if you don't want to use a postgreSQL database to run the test
- Indicate in the `"inputFile"` parameter the file with the input test data. You can find a test file `input_executor.json` in the `testvectors` folder
- Run the Prover from the `testvectors` folder using the command `$ ../build/zkProver`
- The result files of the proof will be stored in the folder specified in the `"outputPath"` config parameter
